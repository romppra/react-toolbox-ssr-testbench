# React-Toolbox SSR Test Bench

This is a simple test bench which can be used to validate react-toolbox SSR capabilities. The core of the project has been copied from toolboxes
specs section. Component references have been changed to use available npm package. The whole thing is then wrapped around quick and dirty
webpack driven SSR configuration.
